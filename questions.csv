"The scores of each SAT test range from 150 to 800 subject.
Let's assume that
The scores are normally distributed.
 The mean score is 500.
  The standard deviation is 100.
1. Create a table shows two columns: Percentiles and Corresponding Scores
Less than or equal to 10% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
Bigger than 10%, but less than or equal to 20% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
Bigger than 20%, but less than or equal to 30% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
Bigger than 30%, but less than or equal to 40% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
Bigger than 40%, but less than or equal to 50% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
...
Bigger than 90% and the corresponding scores for these percentiles
2. Explain how you calculated the values in the table.",hint 9,solution 9
